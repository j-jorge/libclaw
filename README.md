Claw is a generalist library written in C++ and providing various
structures and algorithms.

The story of Claw begins when I wanted to group all the small tools I
have made along my studies at the university. The goal was to learn
how to write reusable code, and to use it in my other projects to
ensure it is actually usable.

Because I wrote that while I was learning how to code, the result is
obviously often poorly designed, based on many decisions I would not
take today. In other words, don't use it, you'll find better libraries
elsewhere :)

People have used the tweener part in their projects in the past. I
would suggest [tweenerspp](https://github.com/j-jorge/tweenerspp)
instead.
