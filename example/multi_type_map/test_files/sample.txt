# this is a test file for the example program of the
# claw::multi_type_map class.

# first, add some item in the map
# syntax is:
#
#   set <key> <type> <value>
#
# where:
# - key is an integer
# - type is b, f, s or c for bool, float, string and custom,
#   respectively
# - value is a value of type <type>
#
# The value for the custom type is a pair of an interger and a string
#
set 0 b 0
set 1 b 1
set 0 f 3.14
set 0 c 72 seventy-two
set 1 s my_favorite_string
set 1 c 24 my_favorite_number

# then, print some values
# syntax is:
#
#   get <key> <type>
#
# where:
# - key is an integer
# - type is b, f, s or c for bool, float, string and custom,
#   respectively
#
get 0 b
get 1 b
get 5 b # does not exist
get 0 f
get 5 f # does not exist
get 0 c
get 5 c # does not exist
get 1 s
get 5 s # does not exist
get 1 c
