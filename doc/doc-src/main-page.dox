\section main-presentation Presentation

The story of Claw begins when I wanted to group all the small tools
I have made along my studies at the university. The library progress
from time to time, mostly when I need a new tool for
<a href="http://plee-the-bear.sf.net/">Plee the Bear</a>, a game I am
actively working on.

Claw wants to be standard compliant and as portable as possible. Of
course, because I'm currently the only developer, the task is a little
bit difficult and you could have some minor problems. If you
experience any problem, please let me know by \ref main-contact
"contacting me".

Claw stands for "C++ Library Absolutely Wonderful".
